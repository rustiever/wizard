Coding is an integral part of any programmer’s life. A programmer’s responsibility does not finish with writing code. The next and most important step is to optimize the code for the betterment of the software.

## What is code optimization?


**Code Optimization** is a technique which tries to improve the code by eliminating unnecessary lines of code and arranging the statements in such a sequence that speed up the program execution without wasting the resources.

Code optimization is necessary to keep your software relevant in the market by delivering speed and efficiency. A programmer is not only needed to write the optimized code but also to optimize the previous code of the application.

**Advantages**:
- Faster execution
- Efficient memory usage
- Yields better performance

In today’s article, we will discuss some simple yet effective techniques to optimize the code. Let’s get started.

***

**1. Compile Time Evaluation**

It is further sub-categorized into two techniques mentioned below:

**a) Constant Folding**

It refers to a technique of executing the expressions whose operands are known to be constant at compile time itself.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:

```
// Before Optimization
public int cal()
{
   return 4 + 7;
}
// After Optimization
public int cal()
{
   return 11;
}

```

The constant folding technique asks us to place evaluated constant expression by ourselves in the code so that compiler does not need to waste time on such operations.

**b) Constant Propagation**

In constant propagation, if a variable is assigned a constant value, then subsequent use of that variable can be replaced by a constant as long as no intervening assignment has changed the value of the variable.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:


```
double pi = 3.14;
int r = 5;
double area = pi * r * r;

```

Here, the value of pi can be replaced by 3.14, and the value of variable r by 5, then computation of area can be done during compilation.

**2. Common Sub-Expression Elimination**

The common sub-expression is an expression reoccurring in the code, which is computed previously. This technique replaces the redundant expression each time it is encountered.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:

```
// Before Optimization
T1 = 4 * i;
T2 = a[T1];
T3 = 4 * j;
T4 = 4 * i;
T5 = n;
T6 = b[T4] + T5;
// After Optimization
T1 = 4 * i;
T2 = a[T1];
T3 = 4 * j;
T5 = n;
T6 = b[T1] + T5;
```

Here, we can see that before optimization, T4 evaluation is the same as for T1, which means we do not have to compute the same thing twice.

**3. Code Movement**

It is a technique of moving a block of code outside a loop if it won’t have any difference if it is executed outside or inside the loop.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:

```
// Before Optimization
for (int i=0; i<n; i+)
{
    x = y+z;
    a[i] = 6 * i;
}
// After Optimization
x = y+z;
for (int i=0; i<n; i+)
{
    a[i] = 6 * i;
}
```

Here, as we can see that assigning of variable ‘x’ is not required inside the loop, so it can be moved outside the loop for better performance.

**4. Dead Code Elimination**

It includes eliminating those line of codes which are either never executed or unreachable, or if executed their output is never used. It is an elementary practice of code optimization.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:

```
// Before Optimization
int i = 0;
if (i==1)
{
    a = x + 5;
}
// After Optimization
int i = 0;
```

Here, we have eliminated the ‘if’ code block as it will always be false, and code inside the ‘if’ statement is unreachable.


**5. Strength Reduction**

It is the replacement of expressions that are expensive with cheaper and simple ones. Here, Expensive expressions are one in terms of execution cost and complexity.

Let’s understand this with the below-mentioned example:

```
// Before Optimization
int B = A * 2;

// After Optimization
int B = A + A;
```

The multiplication operator is [expensive](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21819682/is-integer-multiplication-really-done-at-the-same-speed-as-addition-on-a-modern) in terms of execution compared to the addition operator. In this technique, we usually replace such expensive expressions with the simple ones in our code.


***

**Final Takeaway**

If programming is an art, then optimization is the final touch to your Mona Lisa. In summation, by keeping the below-mentioned techniques in mind, any programmer can optimize the code.

1. Execute operands that are constant for compile-time evaluation. Also, a constant variable can be replaced by the constant value used subsequently in the code.
2. Common sub-expressions can be eliminated to prevent redundant evaluation by the compiler resulting in poor performance.

3. We can move the code block outside the loop that has no impact whatsoever.

4. We have to find and eliminate the unreachable code block or the code block whose output is never utilized elsewhere in the code.

5. We can replace expensive operations with cheaper ones wherever possible. It improves the speed and efficiency of the application.
