# The Simple Push-Up Can Go Terribly Wrong

The push-up is a simple exercise, right? Yes and no. While this movement comes quite naturally to us, we’ve somehow managed to overcomplicate it with unnecessary cues. This trend is, unfortunately, becoming more and more common in the fitness world. While there is certainly a time and space for technicality in the exercises we complete, I fear we’re getting too caught up in the nitty-gritty and it’s beginning to plague our form and function.

Just take the squat for example. Yes, you should be engaging through the core, hinging from the hips, and practicing proper breathing techniques throughout. At the end of the day, however, this is a movement you do every single day, whether it’s sitting at the dinner table or taking care of business in the bathroom. The truth is, we don’t need to be compartmentalizing every inch of the exercise to perform it well.

I see this ‘overthinking mindset’ frequently arise in my client’s push-ups. Fortunately, it can be solved when we strip down the exercise and remind ourselves what the real function of this movement is. All it takes is looking at some simple anatomy to realize that we’ve been doing a lot of chest exercises incorrectly for a very long time.

## What’s Going Wrong
The most frequent error I see with push-ups is people setting their shoulder blades ‘down and back’ throughout the entirety of the exercise. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, just try pinching your shoulder blades together and then lowering them down as far as possible.

This cue is becoming a buzzword in fitness circles, but it’s starting to do more harm than good. While this adjustment may be appropriate in some contexts, it’s merely limiting the action of all chest-related exercises. This is especially apparent when we begin to dissect the anatomy and function of the main chest muscle, the [pectoralis major](https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/major-pectoralis-muscle).

The pectoralis major is involved in bringing the arm bone (humerus) across the body towards the midline. This occurs whenever we press our arms away from the body (punching, throwing, bench press, push-ups, etc…). Unfortunately, when we take on this ‘down and back’ approach with the shoulders, we immediately limit the range of motion that our arms can achieve. This has direct implications for the strength and function of the pecs in achieving safe, complete pressing movements.

The ‘locking’ of the shoulder blades does not only limit the push-up, but it can lead to shoulder joint issues down the road. The arm bone and shoulder blade have a tight-knit relationship known as [scapulohumeral rhythm](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377910/#:~:text=Scapulohumeral%20rhythm%3A%20the%20coordinated%20motion,degree%20of%20scapular%20upward%20rotation).). To allow this connection to function optimally, we must move the shoulder blade with the arm during pressing movements. If we fail to do so, shoulder instability and poor [serratus anterior](https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/serratus-anterior-muscle) muscle engagement can result.

This occurs frequently in push-ups, but also with dumbbell chest presses, bench presses, and other upper-body exercises. Fortunately, there’s an extremely easy remedy to this problem.

## How to Fix It
In anatomical terms, having the shoulders ‘down and back’ means you’re in a constant state of [scapular retraction](https://www.ivyroses.com/Define/Retraction). To reverse this, we simply need to incorporate the opposite movement, [protraction](https://www.google.com/search?q=protraction+of+scapula&oq=protraction&aqs=chrome.0.0i67i457j69i57j0i67j0i67i433j0j0i20i263j0l2.1924j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), back into our body mechanics. This all goes back to not overthinking it. When we complete a push-up or bench press, why wouldn’t we extend all the way up and protract those shoulder blades? Yes, you can squeeze them on the lower, but make sure you separate them on the way back up! Your scapulohumeral rhythm will thank you.

Here is a great exercise to practice incorporating this movement back into your chest exercises. Simply set up in a push-up position, and keep the arms straight as you squeeze (retract) and then separate (protract) the shoulder blades. Once this feels comfortable, toss a full [push-up plus](https://heydaydo.com/push-up-plus/) into the mix (extra protraction at the top). I’d suggest completing a set of 10–20 of these as an effective warm-up for chest day.

As a bonus, this movement will also serve as a great modality for treating an assortment of shoulder and upper back issues, often resulting from overuse injuries or muscle imbalances.

## In Closing,
The pressing action of the push-up is extremely natural for us humans, but we’ve gone and overcomplicated things. Although we must pay attention to form while completing resistance exercises, we should never get to the point where we’re compartmentalizing every inch of a movement and losing sight of the bigger picture.

Remember that resistance exercises often mimic the flow of everyday life and anatomical function. Setting your shoulder blades ‘down and back’ may feel like you’re being more conscious of your form, but in reality, you’re doing more harm than good. When completing the push-up, allow your shoulders to move with your arms…it’s simply what your body was designed to do.

This adjustment will not only strengthen all of your chest exercises, but it will drastically reduce your risk of injury as well. Now go spread the word and let’s restore proper form and function to chest day!
