## What is a day?

We all know there are 24 hours in a day. It’s how we set our clocks and run our lives. But what exactly do we mean by “day”? It turns out there’s more than one way to define it.

A [*sidereal day*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sidereal%20day) is the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once about its axis. That only takes 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds.

In our practical, everyday lives, on the other hand, one day is the 24-hour [*solar day*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/solar%20day). That’s the time it takes between the sun being at its highest point the sky one day to the next.

Where did the extra 4 minutes come from?

## Round and round

The rotation of the Earth around its axis — at around a speed of [1000 miles an hour](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fast-is-the-earth-mov/) — isn’t the only movement of the Earth, of course. Our planet is also hurtling round the sun at [67000 miles an hour](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-fast-is-the-earth-mov/).

The sun it at its zenith at noon. After 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.1 seconds, the Earth has rotated once.

Thing is, it’s also travelled a little bit further on its orbit around the sun. For the sun to reach its next zenith, the planet has to do another 4 minutes of rotation. It’s a bit like being the [teacups ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacups) at a fairground: you sit in a giant spinning teacup which is itself on a platform rotating at a different speed.

That makes the observed solar day 24 hours long.

On average.

### Squashing the circle

Right now, our orbit around this is a little bit off being circular, but not too far off.

During a cycle that takes around 100000 years, Earths’ orbit will [become more elliptical](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/milankovitch-orbital-cycles-and-their-role-in-earths-climate/), that is to say become more of a squashed circle, and back again to being closer to circular (though never becoming completely circular). This is because the pull of gravity from big planets such as Jupiter and Saturn affects our passage through space.

As our orbit is not uniform, the speed the Earth orbits the sun is not uniform either. This has a knock-on effect on the length of a solar day.

We’re closest to the sun in January, called the [*perihelion*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/perihelion) and furthest in July, called the [*aphelion*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aphelion).

When we’re closer to the sun, the Earth moves faster — like swooshing past the ground when you’re on a children’s swing. We don’t need the full 4 minutes to catch up the difference between the sidereal and solar days.

When we’re furthest away we travel a little slower — like the slow point at the top point when on a swing — and we need a bit more time to catch up the time between Earth’s rotation on its axis and the point where the sun is at its highest.

### The middle of the solar system

Despite what we’re taught in school, the sun is not exactly in the middle of the Earth’s orbit either.

Technically, [we don’t orbit the sun](https://www.inverse.com/science/center-of-solar-system), we orbit the [*barycenter*](https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/barycenter/en/) of the solar system. That’s the centre of gravity of the whole solar system — sun, planets, their moons, all the rocks and dust combined. The sun is the biggest body, for sure, and contributes the most but if you look at our orbit in detail, the sun doesn’t sit in the middle. Nearly. But not quite.

## Tilting

We don’t generally notice the effects of the Earth zipping about its orbit making the solar day longer than the sidereal day.

There’s a bigger effect.

The horizontal plane of our annual trip round the sun is called the [*ecliptic*](https://www.britannica.com/science/ecliptic). The Earth doesn’t spin perpendicular to the ecliptic. We’re tilted from the vertical.

Currently, our planet is off the vertical at [23.5 degrees](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Milankovitch/milankovitch_2.php). This offsets the effect of our orbit on day length a bit.

Overall, the tilt has a [bigger effect](https://explainingscience.org/2015/08/24/september-18-the-shortest-day/) on when exactly the sun sits highest in the sky than the variation in our orbit.

This tilt gives us our seasons. It’s important to note that the length of daylight in summer and winter is a different thing to the definition of the *solar day, *which we’ve described as the point between noon one day and the next, regardless of season.

All in all, we get a few extra seconds of solar day in January, followed by June, with lows around the equinoxes in March and September.

Throughout the year this all pretty much evens out to our familiar average of a 24-hour solar day.

## Stargazing

If you’d like to observe the effect of the sidereal day compared to the solar day for yourself, you can go out and do some stargazing.

If you note that time a particular star rises in the night sky, the next day it will rise [4 minutes earlier](https://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/what-is-sidereal-time). And the following day 4 minutes earlier still, and so on. Over a month this will amount to a couple of hours’ difference in rise time.

Against a consistent background of stars, the sidereal day defined by the Earth’s rotation and its yearly orbit means you’ll see different constellations at different times of year.
