# How to Create Audio Books in Any Language With Python

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*O9xmza_tBf-bnzEE-_RUXg.jpeg)

I was mucking around Python a few days ago and I stumbled upon this package called ```pyttsx3``` which is basically a wrapper around various text-to-speech package on different platforms. Text-to-speech is not new to me, of course, but I haven’t done anything with it for a long time. I was impressed with the performance and the advancement in capabilities to say the least, though I think most of it came from the platform itself.

As I was playing around it, an idea popped into my mind — can I use it to create audio books?

Audio books are quite commonplace now. Many books have audio versions — they are sold separately and can cost more than the actual books themselves. Audio books, as the word suggests, are a recording of a book or other work being read out loud, usually by a human narrator. Think The Handmaid’s Tale read by Claire Danes, or Ready Player One read by Whil Wheaton or Becoming read by Michelle Obama.

According to a [Pew Research report](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/25/one-in-five-americans-now-listen-to-audiobooks/) in Oct 2019, 1 out of 5 adults in US listen to audio books, only slightly less than e-books, which has 1 out of 4 adults. In addition, according to [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2020/rise-of-audiobooks-podcast-industry.html#), the audiobook market in 2020 is $3.5 billion. An audio book that’s produced well takes some effort so only the more popular or well-received ones have audio versions. As a result only the more recent ones become audio books.

But what about other books? According to Google, there are about 130 million books in the world, while the largest audio book company in the world, [Audible (an Amazon company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(service)) is reported to have [400,000 titles](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-8024525/From-classics-fantasy-Event-brings-50-audiobooks.html). That’s a lot of books that don’t have audio versions and are unlikely to go the human narration route.

Well, if you can’t get a real human to read you the book, maybe you can try to get a machine to do it. And it seems simple enough with Python so I created a command-line program called [BookSpeak](https://github.com/sausheong/bookspeak) to do exactly that.

## First, get a book

Obviously if we’re going to create audio books, we need to get books first. And of course we want to get a bunch of free books to test on. The first thing that came to mind was the [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), a publicly available library of over 60,000 free ebooks, created from works which are in public domain, mostly as a result of US copyright which has expired (in this case, meaning more than 95 years have passed since its publication)

That’s easy enough. Let’s get started.

## A Scandal in Bohemia

One of my favorite books growing up was[
The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes), by Arthur Conan Doyle. First published on 14 October 1892, it was the first in a series of books featuring the consulting detective [Sherlock Holmes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes). The first story in this book was A Scandal in Bohemia, and it’s also the first audio book I tried to create using ```pyttsx3```.

I’ll jump straight into the code. It’s quite straightforward and is self-contained in a single file.

```
#!/usr/bin/python3

import sys, getopt, pyttsx3

# a simple script to speak out a book or write it into an mp3

# either read the book out aloud or save it to an mp3 file
def speak(bookfile, audiofile, voice, rate):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    if voice != '':
      engine.setProperty('voice', voice)      
    if rate != '':
      engine.setProperty('rate', int(rate))

   # clean up a bit on the text to remove newlines, but not remove paragraph lines
    book = open(bookfile, 'r').read()\
        .replace('\n\n', '*newline*')\
        .replace('\n', ' ')\
        .replace('*newline*', '\n\n')

    if audiofile == '':
       engine.say(book)
    else:
       engine.save_to_file(book, audiofile)
    
    engine.runAndWait()

# assumes running in a MacOS environment
def main(argv):
   book, audio, voice, rate = '', '', '', ''
   try:
      opts, args = getopt.getopt(argv,"hb:a:v:r",["book=","audio=","voice=","rate="])
   except getopt.GetoptError:
      print('speak.py -b <book-file> -a <audio-file> -v <voice-id> -r <words-per-min>')
      sys.exit(2)
   for opt, arg in opts:
      if opt == '-h':
         print('speak.py -b <book-file> -a <audio-file> -v <voice-id> -r <words-per-min>')
         sys.exit()
      elif opt in ("-b", "--book"):
         book = arg
      elif opt in ("-a", "--audio"):
         audio = arg
      elif opt in ("-v", "--voice"):
         voice = arg
      elif opt in ("-r", "--rate"):
         rate = arg                  
   speak(book, audio, voice, rate)    

if __name__ == "__main__":
   main(sys.argv[1:])
```

The real work is done in the ```speak``` function, called by ```main``` after extracting some parameters from the command line:

- **Book file name** — this is mandatory, we need a book to convert an audio book. It should be a book in text format only
- **Audio file name** — this is optional. If you leave it out, the program will just speak the book out aloud. If you provide a file name, it will create an MP3 file with the same name, and that’s the audio book
- **Voice ID** — this is the ID for the voice that’s being used to narrate the book. If you leave it out, it will use the default system voice. A bit more on this later
- **Rate of narration** — this is the speed of narration in the number of words per minute narrated

In the ```speak``` function, we first initialize a ```pyttsx3``` engine using the ```init``` function. With the engine, we set it to the correct voice and rate of narration. Then we open up the text file and grab the whole text (yes, everything).

Project Gutenberg’s text file formatted books have newlines at the end of each line, so I need to clean it up a bit, else it will do a strange little pause after each line (even though it’s in the middle of a sentence).

Finally, if no audio file name is provided, it’ll be spoken out aloud. Else it will be saved as an MP3 file to the given file name.

That’s pretty simple! Now let’s run it.

```
% python3 speak.py --book=bohemia.txt --audio=bohemia.mp3 --rate=175
--voice=com.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.daniel.premium
```

I ran this on my MacBook Pro running MacOS Catalina 10.15.7, using Python 3.6.8. As you can see, I use the ‘Daniel’ voice, which is a British male voice, quite apt for a Sherlock Holmes book.

So where does the voice come from?

## I hear voices

As I mentioned earlier, ```pyttsx3``` is a wrapper package around the text to speech capabilities of the platforms:

- Windows—SAPI5
- MacOS — NSSpeechSynthesizer
- Linux — espeak

I ran this on my MacBook Pro, so what was used are the voices available in NSSpeechSynthesizer. ```pyttsx3``` provides a nice package that lists all voices available on the platform, which can be extracted using a simple program.

```
import pyttsx3

# a simple script to list out all the voices available on your platform
engine = pyttsx3.init()
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
for voice in voices:
    print("Voice: %s" % voice.name)
    print(" - ID: %s" % voice.id)
    print(" - Languages: %s" % voice.languages)
    print(" - Gender: %s" % voice.gender)
    print(" - Age: %s" % voice.age)
    print("\n")
engine.runAndWait()
```

Running this program lists a number of voices like this:

```
Voice: Alex
 - ID: com.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.Alex
 - Languages: ['en_US']
 - Gender: VoiceGenderMale
 - Age: 35
Voice: Alice
 - ID: com.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.alice
 - Languages: ['it_IT']
 - Gender: VoiceGenderFemale
 - Age: 35
...
Voice: Daniel
 - ID: com.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.daniel.premium
 - Languages: ['en_GB']
 - Gender: VoiceGenderMale
 - Age: 35
 ```

 You can see from the list the voice we used (Daniel) has the ID ```com.apple.speech.synthesis.voice.daniel.premium``` and has the language ```en_GB``` which is British English. So what’s with this list and can I add more? It depends on the platform. For MacOS, we can find it under ```System Preferences -> Accessibility -> Speech```.

 ![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*5lyVWXRjQCZwJvHng-0u9A.png)

 You can see the current system voice selected is Daniel. You can click on it and it will show a list of voices that you can use as the default system voice. If you don’t specify the voice when running the earlier program it will just use the default system voice. Which can sound weird if you choose a voice in different language.

You can also download other voices by selecting the checkbox. Once you click on the OK button you will be brought back to the previous screen and the download and installation of the voice starts.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*NHPRrAYABrcrtLgIJr4mMw.png)

You would have noticed the other languages in the list of voices. They are not just for speaking English in foreign accents! In fact you can use the different language voices to also create audio books in different languages.

Let’s try something in French.

## En garde!
For a suitable French language book, I went back to trusty Project Gutenberg and found *Les Trois Mousquetaires*, or what is known to the English-speaking world as *The Three Musketeers*, by Alexandre Dumas.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*EF2wcCUZERR5Yaa5Dy2dWw.jpeg)

I used the Thomas voice which language is ```fr_FR``` to read out the first chapter of the *Les Trois Mousquetaires* and it turned out pretty well! Not that I can really under French but it sounded pretty ok to me. Though I suspect it sounded good precisely I don’t understand French :)

## 108 Heroes of Liang Shan
I was on a roll so I thought next stop would be something further out. Digging into Project Gutenberg again, I found one of the 4 Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, 水浒传 or The Water Margin by 施耐庵 (Shi Nai-an). The story, set towards the end of Northern Song dynasty, tells about how a group of 108 outlaws gathered at Liang Shan (Mount Liang) to form an outlaw band that was eventually grafted by the government as a militia to fight against foreign invaders (Liao) and suppress rebel forces.

The text file is in UTF8 from Project Gutenberg in Traditional Chinese script. I scrubbed the Project Gutenberg header and footer and I only created an audio book from the first chapter, using the female Chinese voice, Ting-Ting. She has the language ```zh_CN``` which is representative of a standard mainland Chinese pronounciation.

It actually sounds decent!

## Light and web novels

But enough about old books. What about some newer books? Well first of all you need to get those books. While most of the popular e-books you buy are usually in ePUB or PDF, there are some popular books (usually fiction) in entirely text format. I’m referring to light novels and web novels.

If you’re like me and like pulpy light or web novels (usually Japanese, Korean or Chinese) you can probably dig around for the text versions of those novels. They are easier to find because there are usually e-book versions. I don’t read Japanese or Korean so I don’t know if this is true for these light novels, but you can usually find text versions of Chinese light or web novels around if you dig hard enough.

If you don’t read Japanese, Korean or Chinese, you can also find plenty of sites out there with English fan-translations. There is even a really cool Python project called the lightnovel-crawler that crawls through a large number of such sites and download and convert them into text format.

This is how you can install lightnovel-crawler.

```
% pip lightnovel-crawler
```

Then you can either use the command-line version or the interactive version. The interactive version is slightly easier to use for a beginner.

Let’s say you want to download a light novel from https://boxnovel.com called Reincarnation of the Strongest Sword God(it’s pretty good). You have find the URL of the novel’s page on the site, which happens to be https://boxnovel.com/novel/reincarnation-of-the-strongest-sword-god-boxnovel/.

You can now go directly to crawl and download using the interactive command-line session:

```
lncrawl -s https://boxnovel.com/novel/reincarnation-of-the-strongest-sword-god/
```

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*kneDPnJgg23mEwuWthrqJw.png)

I choose the first 10 chapters (it’s currently at chapter 2694 as of writing and it’s not over yet — for the record, I gave up around 1000+ but it was quite a read) and then chose to output as text format.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*d7x7JR0cDqQVJHrumscpGg.png)

The program then crawled the site and downloaded the novel and spit out 10 text files, one for each chapter.

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Qolrjm2W53HiG2xeOWOvkg.png)

It turns out pretty acceptable as well. So if you’re into these type of stuff, you can make them into audio books too!

## What about other types of documents?

If fiction books are not your thing and you like to read research papers or white papers from corporations (why?!) you can use another simple Python script to convert PDF files to text first before using BookSpeak.

The problem generally with PDF is that there are a lot of different types of PDFs and they are not all the same. In fact, they are hardly the same most of the time! What this means is that even though there are many different ways to convert PDF to text, you’d likely not be able to use the same technique with all PDFs.

What I found is the easiest to get around the problem of different types of PDFs is to first convert PDF into image files, then use OCR to convert the image to text. In this case, regardless whatever format the original PDF is in, I just need to deal with images and OCR.

For converting a PDF file to images, I used [pdf2image](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image). It’s a pretty simple package but you need to install poppler, a PDF rendering library, first. I use MacOS so the easiest was for me to just use Homebrew to install [popper](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (which can take a while, if poppler dependencies are not already in place).

For OCR, I use [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract), a Python wrapper around Google’s Tesseract OCR engine. You will also need its dependencies, the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and of course, the [Google Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). A bit of trivia here, Tesseract was originally developed at the [HP Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Labs) Bristol, the sister laboratory to the HP Labs Singapore which I used to run.

You can use ```pip``` to install all these dependencies, so it should be quite straightforward. Once you’re done with the dependencies, let’s look at the code.

As before, all the action is in the ```extract``` function, which has 4 parameters — the name of the PDF file, the name of the output text file and optionally the first and last pages you want to convert.

First, we use the ```convert_from_path``` function from pdf2image to convert the given PDF file at 500 dpi, given the first and last pages. If the first and last pages are not given, it will get convert all the pages to images. What is returned is a list of images.

Using this list, we iterate through each image and use the ```image_to_string``` function from ```pytesseract``` to convert the page image to a string, which we then append to the open text file.

Let’s try this on one of my favourite papers — [Schelling’s Dynamic Models of Segregation](https://acoustique.ec-lyon.fr/chaos/Schelling71.pdf).

![image](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Uor2ocn4mq98bXwwZstEfg.png)

I extract just the first page to keep things simple.

Here’s the text file that was generated from the first page.

DYNAMIC MODELS OF SEGREGATION t+
THOMAS C. SCHELLING
Harvard University
Some segregation results from the practices of organizations, some from specialized communication
systems, some from correlation with a variable that is non-random; and some results from the
interplay of individual choices. This is an abstract study of the interactive dynamics of discriminatory
individual choices. One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable
groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second
model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to
‘neighborhood tipping.’ The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple
correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning
result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn
from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated.
A general theory of ‘tipping’ begins to emerge.
People get separated along many lines and in many ways. There is segregation by
Sex, age, income, language, religion, color, taste, comparative advantage and the
accidents of historical location. Some segregation results from the practices of
organizations; some is deliberately organized; and some results from the interplay
of individual choices that discriminate. Some of it results from specialized communication systems, like different languages. And some segregation is a corollary
of other modes of segregation: residence is correlated with job location and transport.
If blacks exclude whites from their church, or whites exclude blacks, the segregation
is organized, and it may be reciprocal or one-sided. If blacks just happen to be Baptists
and whites Methodists, the two colors will be segregated Sunday morning whether
they intend to be or not. If blacks join a black church because they are more comfortable
among their own color, and whites a white church for the same reason, undirected
individual choice can lead to segregation. And if the church bulletin board is where
people advertise rooms for rent, blacks will rent rooms from blacks and whites from
whites because of a communication system that is correlated with churches that are
correlated with color.
Some of the same mechanisms segregate college professors. The college may own
some housing, from which all but college staff are excluded. Professors choose housing
commensurate with their incomes, and houses are clustered by price while professors

It’s pretty good! It’s inevitable, with page numbers and footnotes, as well as figures and diagrams, that we’ll need to clean things up a bit. Of course, if you don’t mind them it’s all good.

This is the audio book generated from the text above, without any cleaning up.

## Listen away!
It’s surprisingly easy to generate relatively decent audio books in multiple languages with just a few lines of code in Python. And similarly you can convert PDFs and other types of documents to audio books as well.

All the code above can be found in the [Github repository](https://github.com/sausheong/bookspeak) below. Give it a spin and see how it works from you!
