# So Many Commitments, So Little Time

How do you manage to get things done? Or do you?

I’m asking because I really want to know. As someone who is overcommitted and has a hard time saying no, this is an important question.

I thought by having to shelter in place, my life would get a little less busy. After all, I am not driving here and there for meetings, errands, outings, and gatherings.

Instead, I am often on one zoom call after another after another. If you take out the time it would take to drive somewhere to meet or gather, the calls can be back to back. Thus they seem to multiply and stack up.

While I don’t have any children or elders to care for, I am the Board President of my church. As such, I do my best to stay connected with and offer support for our congregation. Since we aren’t meeting in person, this takes place via phone or zoom.

Those are the calls I am on camera for.

For some of the classes I am taking or writing workshops I’m in, I can show up on audio-only without being on camera.

This is a blessing, and I’m so glad Zoom gives us this option. There are times when I need to pay close attention and take copious notes.

At other times, I just listen and absorb. That way, I can eat my lunch, stand and stretch or even fold some laundry while remaining connected and engaged.

Many of these calls are recorded. Even though I have a bad case of FOMO — fear of missing out, I actually can go back and listen to them later.

That way, I can get caught up on my sleep, writing, or homework for the next zoom class! FYI — when you watch replays, you can speed them up. There are settings for 1.5 and 2 times the actual speed you can use to save time.

## Whose life is it anyway?

Because of all the demands on my time, I constantly remind myself that it is my life; I’m in charge. This means learning to say no, not right now, or let’s reschedule.

Here’s a phrase I use: that doesn’t work for me. No need to explain why. Just say it. Memorize it till it rolls off your tongue.

## Know the difference between urgent and important.

Some things are **important**, but they aren’t **urgent**. Rescheduling for a time when I’m fresh may mean it takes half the time to do, like organizing my google docs. Or having a zoom call with my niece and her baby, which I will enjoy more if not anxious about an upcoming deadline.

Some things are **urgent**, even when they may not be very **important**, such as rescheduling an appointment in time to not get penalized. Or returning library books on time.

These are the kinds of things I put on a to-do list, so I’ll remember them. I like to get them done and out of the way quickly, so I can focus on **urgent** and **important** things.

My health, for example.

I support my health by taking a walk every day. Do I multi-task on my walks? Not every single time, but yes, often I do. Sometimes I walk with a friend. We get our visit and our exercise at the same time. Or I’ll return books to the library.

And yes, I make phone calls when I walk. Arriving back home is a good tickler — boundary if I need one to gracefully wrap up the call.

## Some things are neither urgent nor important.

I’m racking my brain for an example…oh, okay. Going to Starbucks or Peet’s for a pumpkin spice latte is neither urgent nor important. Considering the ingredients, it’s not even something I want to be consuming gobs of.

Before COVID, I did. Now, it’s an occasional treat/reward, like after a dental procedure. My waistline thanks me. I save time and money. Between the soy milk and the maple scone, these puppies add up!

## Getting better at using snippets of time.

Fifteen minutes here, twenty there add up. Every second does not have to be scheduled. All of us need some noodling downtime.

But when up against a deadline, I put those snippets to work. If I can get the dishes done, that’s one less chore whispering do me! Do me! in my ear when I’m trying to write my great American novel or a Middle-Pause pump-priming prompt.

I may not have time to do a whole blog post in one sitting.

But I can play with titles and make an outline. That way, ideas are percolating while I wash those darn dishes or do my grocery run, stocking up for the whole week instead of going three times. When I come back, I put my thoughts on the page and let them marinate.

My next pass is a re-write/edit, a run through Grammarly, and one of my favorite parts, picking the photo from Unsplash.com. I can be pretty fussy, but it’s fine with me if it’s a picture I’ve used before — if it was that good and fits my topic. (I did that recently here on Middle-Pause, but I bet you wouldn’t notice if I didn’t confess.)

All that being said, I don’t get everything done on time. And sometimes not at all. But hopefully, I’ve learned to prioritize, so it wasn’t anything important.

## So enough about me. It’s your turn!

How do you manage to get everything done? Or do you? How do you prioritize and/or say no? Your experience may help someone else — like me!

Looking forward to hearing from you!
