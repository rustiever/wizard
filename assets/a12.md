So you’re teaching yourself to code, congrats! No, seriously, you’ve taken steps on a journey filled with opportunity, challenges, and rewards. You may have just written your first “Hello, world” program or maybe you’re even a little deeper in, honestly it doesn’t matter, this applies to all!

So at many points while I was teaching myself how to code I remember thinking is this really worth it? I have a wife, 4 kids, and I was working a full time job that was physically demanding and by the time the kids were asleep and I finally had some quiet time to work on coding tutorials and projects, I was fuckin’ toast. There were nights when I was so tired from the day that I would read about a concept and go to practice it with a mini project and when it came time to actually type out some code…. I realized I had pretty much zoned out and not actually absorbed anything I had just read or watched. It was moments like these where I would get frustrated and want to treat my laptop like a discus at the Olympics. My time and energy was limited and when I would have to go back and re read or re watch something just because I was tired, it really irked the shit out of me.

I think anyone who teaches themselves to code runs into situations like this, the situations where shit gets hard, like really hard. And I know there’s nothing special or unique about what my circumstances were back then but everything is relative and everyone has different causes for those moments when they want to toss in the towel and quit learning about AJAX or OOP best practices. The point I’m making here is there’s going to be times where shit gets hard and you want to quit but I’m here to tell you, don’t. No seriously, DO NOT QUIT. Need a break? Fine, close the laptop and take a break. Need help? Fine, ask for help or google that shit. But whatever you do, don’t quit.

’m saying don’t quit because aside from wanting to see other people succeed, I truly do believe the journey of becoming a professional, self taught programmer / coder is worth the blood, sweat, and tears. Ya see, back in the day I worked my ass off at a job where I made crap money. Like, I was broke before the paycheck and I was broke after the paycheck came in and paid bills. It stressed me out, and not because I’m some macho guy with my pride, it’s because that feeling of making a choice as to what bill isn’t going to get paid that month or how the fuck I am going to pay to sign my kid up for that sport they really want to pay gave me a sickening feeling in my gut that I will never forget as long as I live.

I also had many people tell me I was going to burn myself out, it wasn’t going to be worth it, I just had to live my life or I was going to look back with regrets at things I missed out on trying to go down this coding path. But hey, you want to know what’s really cool now? Paying my fucking bills (on time I might add), being able to provide for my family, being able to actually do those things to enjoy my life and not have to want to vomit when it came time to pay for it. I have more time with my family now and in that time I have more energy with them because I’m not exhausted to killing myself physically at my job. I put in the time, and the effort, I hit the grind and kept grinding when it got hard. I can’t tell you how many times I think back to all the times I almost quit and I thank whatever higher power exists in this universe that I didn’t.

I can share this with all of you because today I am a professional software engineer at an amazing company out of Boston and I also take on client’s on the side doing freelance web development. I am here because as a direct result of the work I put in. So to all you out there teaching yourself this amazing skill set, keep at it. Keep grinding even when it gets harder, keep grinding when it gets even harder, because it will. But I promise you, this juice is worth the squeeze.
