# We could put them in a park! Call it “Jurassic Park”!

Listen, before you start with me — yes, I’ve both seen (and read) Jurassic Park. I’ve also seen most of the sequels, including Jurassic World, where despite the best intentions of Star-Lord, humans did everything wrong and Jimmy Buffett nearly gets eaten by a pterodactyl.

Yet despite this very scientifically accurate warning, I still finished those movies with a renewed interest in science. *If we didn’t make the boneheaded mistakes of the movie protagonists, could we actually bring back dinosaurs?*

Now, with a PhD in genetics, I’m revisiting this questions from my childhood.

**Could we bring a dinosaur to life today?**

**And if so, how would we do it?**

Let’s learn a little bit more about very old DNA, how cloning works, and the mechanics of attempting to raise dinosaurs to walk the earth again, 65 million years later.

And surely, nothing will go wrong this time.

## First Challenge: Getting the Blueprints

Just like in Jurassic Park, we need to start by getting our hands on the blueprint for how to make a dinosaur. In other words, we need some dino DNA.

Unfortunately, this is a tougher challenge than what’s shown in the movie. See, DNA is a fairly stable molecule, compared to many others (RNA, the single-stranded cousin of DNA, will break down in a matter of minutes if it’s not stabilized), but it’s not eternal.

![Even if you trap one of these guys in amber, it’s still gonna break down.

DNA, meanwhile, will break down over time, and will go faster if it’s exposed to heat, sunlight, water, or any combination of the three. The backbone of the DNA breaks in more and more places, splitting DNA into smaller and smaller fragments.

[A recent estimate of the half-life of DNA puts it at around 521 years.](https://www.livescience.com/23861-fossil-dna-half-life.html) This means that, after 521 years, half the links in the DNA backbone would have broken. After 1,042 years, three-quarters of the links in the DNA backbone would be broken.

Run the equation a few more times, and we end up with our DNA being completely degraded after about 6.8 million years, even if the DNA is stored in ideal conditions (trapped in frozen ice with no temperature fluctuations, for example).

But even before six million years, the vast majority of the links would be destroyed — which means that the DNA would be broken into pieces too small for us to put back together. Imagine trying to reassemble a shredded document — if it’s shredded to the point where each scrap has only an individual letter, you’re not going to be able to rebuild the document.

So how could we get the DNA to build a dinosaur?

It looks like we won’t be able to go traditional on this; we’ll need to create a Franken-dinosaur. We could start with the DNA of a bird, which is the closest living relative to a dinosaur, and blend it with some crocodile DNA.

This is going to require significant advancements in genetic engineering, but we’re starting to now develop some of the needed basic tools, such as CRISPR.

We’ll have to build our own dinosaur DNA from scratch, but it’s the only avenue we’ve got.

## Second Challenge: The Right Baby Oven

Getting the DNA blueprint may be the first step, but we can’t make a new organism out of solely DNA. We need the protein and other components of a cell — and we need the proper inputs at the right times to encourage it to grow and develop into a full organism.

This will likely need to be an iterative process. Can you imagine a chicken laying an egg that a dinosaur just pops out of? Not going to happen.

Instead, we’ll likely have to breed a series of creatures that, with each generation, are modified to be more and more similar to dinosaurs. We’ll have to modify genes to make these creatures larger, which will probably take several generations. We’ll also want to make other modifications, to get stronger bones, alter the digestive system, bulk up muscle, and other tweaks to get these animals more similar to dinosaurs.

And don’t forget, we currently don’t quite have the technology to make these sorts of alterations, although we are close — we have the basic tools to modify DNA, but not the knowledge of which modifications to make.

## Third Challenge: Herbivores

One possible way to avoid a Jurassic Park dinosaurs-run-amok-eating-people scenario? Go for the herbivores.

After all, there were many plant-eating dinosaurs, who wouldn’t pose a threat to humans (unless they stepped on one of us). They may not be quite as exciting to see as a *Tyrannosaurus, *but at least they’d only be interested in taking a bite of you if you wore a green shirt.

Unfortunately, in order to find a living vegetarian reptile, we’ll need to start with either a tortoise or a lizard (think iguana). These creatures are going to be even further removed from typical dinosaurs, which means that even more work and more modifications, more rounds of iterative breeding, would be needed to create a herbivorous dinosaur.

So, could we bring a dinosaur back to life today?

The answer is yes — although it won’t be reviving an extinct, specific species of dinosaur. They are just too old, and the fossils and remnants of dinosaurs that we excavate don’t have any intact genetic material that we could use to reconstruct their blueprint. We can’t bring back dinosaurs as they existed before.

Instead, the best approach that we have for bringing a dinosaur to life is to create a Frankenstein-esque version of these past creatures. We’ll modify currently living animals, such as a chicken or a crocodile, to re-introduce traits that existed in the past, in order to make it more dinosaur-like.

This idea isn’t new; [Wired did a great article focusing on Jack Horner, a highly respected scientist tackling the same approach](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/ff_chickensaurus/). He’s looking to reverse the last 65 million years of evolution on chickens, reverting them back into something similar to a dinosaur.

In the end, we can’t bring the dinosaurs back — but if a sufficiently motivated billionaire wanted to start a breeding program (hello, Bezos? You could sell dinosaur eggs exclusively on Prime!), they could create a new creature with the same qualities as a dinosaur.

And most of the attendees at the Jurassic Park won’t mind if the animal isn’t exactly historically accurate.
