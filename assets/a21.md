Ancient, iron-rich dust played a role in global cooling during the last ice age. This theory is based on studying 18 sediment cores across the South Pacific Ocean between Chile, Antarctica, and New Zealand. The work identifies iron-bearing dust layers trapped in marine sediments. These dust layers were deposited about 20,000 years ago, during the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. This period corresponded to the last glacial maximum — the coldest part of the glacial cycle.

The iron-bearing dust, which contributed to global cooling, came from the Patagonia region of South America. This area has the environmental preconditions to produce dust rich in iron: high elevation, arid conditions, fluvial activity to move sediments through streams and rivers, and high levels of glacial activity during glacial intervals.

## The right environment

High elevations and an arid environment create conditions where dry dust is exposed to intense winds, allowing the particles to be lifted and entrained into global wind currents. This situation is ideal for transporting Patagonian dust on the westerly winds circling the globe around Antarctica. Sediments and dust picked up in South American during the last ice age traveled eastward on a circumpolar journey, eventually settling out over the South Pacific Ocean.

Fluvial activity from rivers and streams was responsible for transporting dust particles out of the highlands and concentrating them in the alluvial fans of distributed river systems, and in playa lakes. These are not rivers that run to the sea. Instead, these river systems drain into the arid desert regions and eventually evaporate or sink into the groundwater systems. Either way, the silt and clay particles become concentrated in local areas where they can await transport on the winds.

The last of the environmental conditions — high levels of glacial activity during glacial intervals — is a critical part of the system. Iron reacts with oxygen and water in the atmosphere, and we sometimes refer to this chemical reaction as rusting. So, the longer iron is exposed to the elements, the more it weathers. Now glaciers are more than icy flows down mountain slopes. The pressure from tons of ice moving over the landscape lets glaciers excavate and erode the underlying rock. The rock is pulverized under these intense pressures creating new, un-weathered rock-dust — an erosional product, which in the Patagonia area, is rich in fresh iron.

## Iron, an essential element of life

The story of iron begins in intergalactic space, deep within a type of star known as a red giant. Inside the star, its hydrogen is gone, and helium converts to carbon and oxygen atoms. As the process continues, these atoms slowly change into the heaviest type of atom a star can produce — iron. When these atomic conversions finish running their course, the red giant contains vast amounts of iron. This stage marks the end of its life, and if the star is large enough, it becomes a supernova and undergoes one of the most violent processes know in the universe. The red giant explodes, spewing iron, carbon, and oxygen across the vast reaches of space.

This intergalactic stardust eventually finds its way into gravity wells where it collapses into planets. Our Earth coalesced through this process some 4.5 billion years ago. Within the core of planet Earth, where temperatures exceed 6000 degrees Celsius, iron is the dominant ingredient, and the planet’s crust, directly beneath our feet, contains about 5 percent iron.

Life evolved on our planet needing iron. It is one of the critical ingredients of life. Humans, animals, and plants all require iron to sustain life. Hemoglobin in every human’s blood requires iron to function, and about 70 percent of our body’s iron exists in blood cells. Importantly for the story of iron and ice, marine phytoplankton need iron. The amount of iron present in marine water is often a limiting factor in phytoplankton population growth.

Iron is a micronutrient necessary for a wide range of metabolic functions in phytoplankton, and it is availability is crucial to photosynthesis. The lack of iron in the South Pacific is a known limiting factor for the phytoplankton populations there.

A second important aspect of phytoplankton is their ability to act as a carbon sink. These creatures use carbon to build their tiny shells. The shell-building process effectively extracts CO2 from the ocean waters and sequesters it in their shells. As they die, the shells sink to the ocean bottom. When CO2 levels in the oceans drop, the waters can absorb additional CO2 from the atmosphere, thus reducing atmospheric CO2 and reducing the atmospheric greenhouse effect.

## Global Cooling

Glaciers, dust, wind, and phytoplankton conspired 20,000 years ago to bring on global cooling. The cycle started with the production of fine-grained iron-rich particles as glacial activity eroded fresh rock in the mountains of Central South America. Meltwater streams carried silt and sediment from the high glaciers to arid, desert environments where the streams dried up, leaving iron-rich dust deposits.

The westerly polar winds that circle Antarctica picked up this dust in the high deserts and carried it eastward around the globe, finally depositing it in the South Pacific Ocean. Critical to this story is the oxidation state of iron in the Patagonian dust. Iron is found in two relevant oxidation states: Fe (II) and Fe (III). Of the two, FE (II) is the most soluble and most useful to phytoplankton, but oxidation during weathering gradually transforms Fe (II) into Fe (III). So the influx of fresh, poorly weathered F2(II) iron during the last glacial maximum was a boon to the phytoplankton, and populations grew rapidly.

The expanding phytoplankton populations absorbed additional marine carbon and subsequently allowed the oceans to reduce atmospheric CO2 by 40 ppm. It’s important to remember the greenhouse effect goes two ways. Increasing amounts of atmospheric greenhouse gases cause global warming like we are experiencing today. But decreasing greenhouse gases have the opposite effect and drive global cooling. The Late Wisconsinan glacial cooling is a reminder of how iron and ice are connected.

Iron from South American glaciation circumnavigated the globe on westerly winds, where it was deposited in the ocean, providing the micronutrients needed to increase phytoplankton populations. The phytoplankton subsequently worked to remove CO2 from the atmosphere creating global cooling and driving the last ice age into its coldest phase. Our planet is an interdependent web of cause and effect where dust in Patagonia leads to global cooling. Science lets us understand the relationships driving climate change. Let’s hope we soon return to science-based decision making.
