## Tip: Keep a brain-dump list for the time between catch-up sessions.

You know that feeling when you finally sign on to a long-awaited Zoom with a friend, and you know there was a story you wanted to tell them, but you cannot for the life of you remember what that story was?

It’s frustrating. But it’s also easy to prevent: In the space between catch-ups, write down everything you know you’ll want to say. Keep a list in whatever form you find easiest: Maybe that’s the Notes app on your phone, or index cards. Or maybe it’s a Google doc you both contribute to, so when the time comes to actually sit down and talk, you can prioritize together to make sure you cover everything you wanted to.
